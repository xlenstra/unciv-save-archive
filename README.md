# unciv-save-archive
Repository for archived multiplayer save games of [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv).

All multiplayer games in unciv are saved in a dropbox account, which only has 2.5 GB of storage. As almost every 5 minutes a new multiplayer game begins, this account fills up _fast_. Every few months, I thus manually run a python script to download and then delete all these save files, freeing up space for newer games.
